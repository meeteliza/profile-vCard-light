          <p>
            On different occasions both Chinese and American leaders have spoken of their reluctance to engage in a “new cold war.” President Xi Jinping in the Governance of China not only stresses upon the fact that the Cold War blocs confrontation has long gone, but also reiterates China’s commitment to abandon the Cold War mentality and to foster a new thinking of comprehensive security and cooperative security (Xi, 2013a, pp.298; Xi, 2013b, pp.322; Xi, 2015, pp.572). President Joe Biden in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly states that the US is “not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs”, to which national security advisor Jake Sullivan adds that the US prefers “a system of peaceful coexistence” (BBC News, 2021; Wang, 2021). Nonetheless, despite these public discourses of denial, many scholars have in fact brought the discussion of a possible new cold war between China and the US to the forefront; some are in line with the official stances and defy such possibilities while others believe it to be a reality that the cold war has already started. Among them, Hal Brands and John Lewis Gaddis (2021) defining “cold war” as “a protracted international rivalry” claim that the two countries are entering their own cold war and examine the certainty and uncertainty manifested in Sino-US relations from a historical perspective (Brands & Gaddis, 2021, pp.1). The present essay summarizes their major arguments and then gives a brief response.
          </p>

          <p>
            With regard to the future of this alleged cold war, Brands and Gaddis contend that there are 3 knowns, namely geography, the relationship between geography and governance, roots of resilience, and 3 unknowns corresponding to the knowns, namely what is the implication of BRI to Eurasia and to the world, why Xi is abandoning the reform championed by Deng and conducive to economic growth, and whether Xi is able to put internal outrage under control. First, by geography, Brands and Gaddis mean that the drastically different geographical conditions for China and the US grand them different strategical advantages or disadvantages: China, being a land power, has to worry about the resistance from its neighboring countries, if it decides to expand outwards, or about the risk for lining up with wolves in sheep’s clothing, if it decides to cooperate extensively with its neighbors (pp.1); in contrast, the US is given a “hybrid hegemony” due to its access to two oceans and its control of a whole continent – neither of its neighbors is capable enough of challenging that hegemony. However, the uncertainty lies in whether there would be attempts from the counterparts to actively change the balance of power pre-determined by geography, exemplified by Russia’s trans-Siberian railroad and perhaps China’s Belt and Road Initiative (pp.2). The second known is that continents breed authoritarians, because the boundary of land power is harder to be drawn compared with maritime powers, and authoritarians will erode from within, because they are held accountable for pretty much everything that goes wrong within the country (pp.3). According to Brands and Gaddis, there are signs of authoritarianism currently in China, especially if one takes into account Xi’s behavior at home – strengthening the control of discourse power and changing his term limit – and abroad – taking up an increasingly assertive stance (pp.3). The unknown stemming therefrom is why Xi would take such a policy shift, and they provide several plausible reasons already, i.e., Xi’s fear of his retirement before achieving his ambition and Xi’s losing sight of the gap between promises and performance (pp.3). The latter reason gives birth to the third known, that is, different roots of resilience in China and the US, or whether there is a center of gravity inherent in their political system, so to speak (pp.4). The US, with the separation of powers serving as the center of gravity, is capable of maintaining the right direction of development (including the ability to separate promises and performance), whereas China, in the absence of a gravity center, is more easily swayed into the wrong direction and needs more time to recover if things actually go wrong. The corresponding unknown therefore is whether Xi is capable of manipulating public spirits in China to achieve his ambition or becomes desperately dependent on the existence of an external target for unifying domestic voices (pp.4). In addition to the preceding knowns and unknowns, there are 2 other knowns that Brands and Gaddis champion: first, there could be long peace resulting from the tension among two confronting blocs; second, the possibility for surprises is high, be it international catastrophes, regional unrests, or geopolitical earthquakes. To make the most of the knowns and to survive the unknowns, they re-examine the legacy of the containment theory and come up with three instructive suggestions, namely to apply theory with flexibility, to utilize the resistant sentiment of other countries against potential hegemony or common enemy, and to preserve domestic election system (pp.9-10). 
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as I’m concerned, normalizing cold war as any international rivalry helps to ease the tension between the rival states. The traditional definition of cold war as variants of the Cold War or as part of “the Thucydides trap” to me resembles the Sword of Damocles which hangs somewhere above the head and can drop down at any given minute, and which gives rise to other rhetoric including “Washington hegemony”, “China threat”, and an inescapable destiny that two countries going into wars. But perhaps we still need a new name of reference in replace of the “cold war”, in case anyone would take it literally as a war or mistakenly as the capitalized Cold War. I always believe it is our obligation to lead the tide, instead of conforming effortlessly to what is popular (meaning discussing the possibility of a cold war between China and the US is a popular topic).
          </p>

          <p>
            Another enlightening moment that Brands and Gaddis incur is when they claim the election system can cultivate self-awareness (pp.9). There are two major types of governance, top-down and bottom-up. In a top-down system, leaders decide what policy to be taken, whereas in a bottom-up system, people have a final say. I used to prefer the former to the latter, as I believe policy yielded out from the latter can only be compromises, which serves only partially its target audience. But according to Brands and Gaddis, the bottom-up approach, election included, can to a great extent prevent group thinking and protect diversity whereas a top-down government can sometimes be lost in its own illusions. the law of gravity. Though I still could not decide which is the ultimate best way of setting up policy agenda, their work has certainly exposed me to another alternative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Insightful as the article may be, I remain to be convinced with regard to the first and second knowns about geographical determinism and the relationship between geography and governance. For one thing, advances in both transportation and communication technology have greatly altered the geographic landscape, in a way accelerating continental drift. Physically, new ways of transportation such as the continental railroad bridges oceans and continents, as Brands and Gaddis thus acknowledge. Virtually, national borders in Cyberspace are even harder to define, but so far there’s not a single information war that breaks out because of elusive boundaries, except for some unsuccessful accusations that a country intrudes on another country’s civil or military data. As a result, I believe geography brings more uncertainty than certainty. For another, that continents breed authoritarianism does not make much logical sense or even empirical sense. When Brands and Gaddis establish the link between geography and the type of governance, they actually stop at analyzing the land powers, leaving the ocean powers unaddressed. Does it follow that ocean powers breed imperialism, under the same geographic determinism logic? Besides, empirically, there are certainly land powers that are not authoritarian and ocean powers that are authoritarian. I see no necessary connection between geography and types of governance.
